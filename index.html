            Write a paragraph about myself? I don't think I can. I'm not that interesting.
            The year is 2018 and I have entered UNC's coding bootcamp thanks to a series
            of depressive events and episodes that have lead me here. Following my father's
            path of coding, I strive to be as good as if not better than him even though
            he has over 30 years of experience and the entire notion is silly. Come
            along with me as a potentially succeed in something that will change my life
            forever. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 
            I didn't make it to the other line. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
            HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
